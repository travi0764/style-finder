# Style Finder

Style Finder is a powerful AI-driven tool designed to help users find similar garments online by analyzing uploaded images of clothing. Users can upload a picture, specify garment details, and receive recommendations for similar items from online shopping platforms.

## Features

- **Garment Detection and Description**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API to generate detailed descriptions of uploaded images.
- **Embeddings Generation**: Leverages DINOv2 to compute embeddings for similarity comparison.
- **Search Capability**: Scrapes Google Shopping for related garments and ranks them based on similarity.
- **Multi-layer Support**: Allows users to specify whether the uploaded garment is an upper layer (e.g., T-shirt, jacket) or lower layer.
- **Modular Design**: Includes separate services for embedding generation, image comparison, and scraping, enabling flexibility and scalability.
